---------
- Reviewing projects in the Javascript 30 course. Acclimating to the goals of the course and determining a site structure for a navigable website that can show off progress of my work.
- Added template from Dreamweaver CC (corporate template). This will act as a "table of contents" homepage where I can show off my javascript30 work and organize an easy-to-access navigation structure.
